I am currently in the process of shutting down three Tier 2 servers with somewhat significant usage, so I figured Iâ€™d notify you all. Any users of the Tier 2 servers ns5.any, ns4.ny.us, or ns10.ny.us should switch to another server as soon as possible. Uptime is guaranteed for the next 14 days. They are currently listed as disabled.

**Update 06-18:** Just a reminder, the servers have been online for well past the 14 days mentioned originally, but today they're finally going offline. If anyone is still using ns10.ny.us, ns5.any, or ns4.ny.us (the adblocking experimental server) you should switch as quickly as possible (~1 hour or less to decommissioning).
