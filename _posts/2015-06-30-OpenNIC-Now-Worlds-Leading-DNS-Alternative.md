FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:

OpenNIC to become world's leading DNS alternative after
Cisco/OpenDNS deal

June 30, 2015 - With the Cisco acquisition of OpenDNS, OpenNIC is now
positioned as the only viable, open and democratic DNS alternative.

OpenNIC fears this recent acquisition will adversely impact current
OpenDNS users, giving Cisco large-scale access to the DNS records of
OpenDNS subscribers. OpenNIC, founded in 2000, built its foundation based upon the ideal of an open, transparent, and democratic DNS. We remain true to our roots, and welcome all OpenDNS users who value the privacy of their data.
