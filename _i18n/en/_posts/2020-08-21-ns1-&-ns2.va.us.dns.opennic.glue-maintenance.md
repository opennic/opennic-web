Hello,

The datacenter in Vint Hill, VA that I use to host these nodes plan to have an outage that will effect these nodes for 10-20 minutes starting at 8pm ET on Aug 27, 2020. This work is to update the code on the switches that support these machines.

**Notable Changes**

No notable changes are expected to occur, this is just notification of planned network outage.
